# ðŸ“š MyReads â€” keep track of your books

This is a small React app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently. reading, or want to read.

A demo can be viewed [here](https://build-vfllayvivx.now.sh/)

 To run this project locally:

2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn start`
4. open `localhost:3000`


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
